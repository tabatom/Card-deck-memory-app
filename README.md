# Card-deck-memory-app

Simple app developed using Android Studio and Kotlin.

The app's scope is to shuffle and browse a deck of French poker cards to allow the user to memorize them.

I made this for personal use because I am practicing in memorizing French deck cards every morning as memory and concentration excercize; I also did it to learn a bit about Android Studio and phone app programming.

The app has not been released to Google Play Store. The only version available for now is the debug one, which is not public and should be built locally as .apk.

There are some improvement that can be made:
- rework graphic to be able to deal with dark mode (now the reset button is almost not visible)
- add reset "current" deck instead of resetting the seed also
- rethink graphic as the deck has no sense for this app, it is only occupying space
- add buttons to go to the beginnign and to the end of the current deck
